# Augmented_Reality
This repository implements an augmented reality (AR) application using OpenCV to overlay video frames onto a book cover visible in a video. The process includes detecting correspondences, computing a homography matrix, and creating a seamless integration of video frames onto the book in each frame of the input video.
